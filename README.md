# Superstore-Sales-Overview
This project demonstrates the creation of an interactive sales dashboard using Power BI.  The data used is sample superstore sales data, commonly used for learning and demonstration purposes.  The dashboard includes visualizations for:

* Overall sales performance (total sales, profit, average order value)
* Sales trends over time (monthly, yearly)
* Sales performance by customer segment (Consumer, Corporate, Home Office)
* Sales performance by product category (Furniture, Office Supplies, Technology)
* Sales performance by region (East, West, Central, South)

The dashboard is designed to provide actionable insights into sales performance and identify areas for potential improvement.
